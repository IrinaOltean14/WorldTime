# WorldTime
Getting started with Flutter.


The World Time app in Flutter allows users to select locations worldwide (from a list of predefined locations) and instantly fetches and displays the current time for the chosen location. It provides a simple interface with location flags, time display, and day/night indication, making it convenient for users to check time zones across the globe.
